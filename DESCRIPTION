Description: WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis) is a very 
    useful tool for identifying co-expressed gene modules and detecting their 
	correlations to phenotypic traits. Here, we explored more possibilities 
	about it and developed the R package CWGCNA (causal WGCNA), which works 
	from the traditional WGCNA pipeline but mines more information. It couples 
	a mediation model with WGCNA, so the causal relationships among the WGCNA 
	modules, module features, and phenotypes can be identified, demonstrating 
	whether the module change causes the phenotype change or vice versa. After 
	that, when annotating the module gene set functions, CWGCNA uses a novel 
	network-based method, considering the modulesâ€™ topological structures and 
	capturing their influence on the gene set functions. In addition to these 
	biological explorations, CWGCNA also contains a machine learning section 
	to perform clustering and classification on multi-omics data, given the 
	increasing popularity of this kind of data. Some basic functions, such as 
	differential feature identification, are also available in our package.
